# Fun Facts!

A simple website built for fun to learn how to use web technologies such as React.js, Supabase and Vercel in my spare time.

## Features

- Feature 1: Adding your own fact to the website's database hosted on Supabase!
- Feature 2: Voting system that consists of 3 voting options like, dislike and crazy.
- Feature 3: Community feedback to decide what fact is right or wrong based on votes.
- Feature 4: A category filtering to browse between the different types of facts displayed on the site.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS and Javascript: Basic web technologies 
- React.js: Javascript library used to create the main page of the website and make it dynamic
- Supabase: A database hosting website using a PostgresSQL database used to hold facts and votes.
- Vercel: A deployment service used to deploy the website from the GitHub repo!
